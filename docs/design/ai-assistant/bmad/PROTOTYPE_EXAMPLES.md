# BMAD Prototype Examples for Simple Container

## üéØ Overview

This document provides concrete examples and prototypes demonstrating how the BMAD-inspired agentic system would work in practice. These examples show real user interactions, context documents, and agent behaviors for common Simple Container use cases.

## üîç Example 1: Go Microservice with Redis and MongoDB

### User Interaction Flow

```
User: "Help me set up Simple Container for my Go API project"

üß† SC Analyst Agent (Alex): 
"I'll analyze your project to understand its requirements and resources."

[Analyzing project structure...]
[Running resource detection...]
[Assessing complexity...]

"Analysis complete! I've detected a Go microservice using Gin HTTP framework with:
‚Ä¢ MongoDB database (85% confidence) - primary data storage
‚Ä¢ Redis cache (80% confidence) - session and data caching  
‚Ä¢ 17 environment variables - including database connections and API keys
‚Ä¢ S3 integration (70% confidence) - file storage capabilities

This is a moderately complex setup that will benefit from managed database services. 
Handing off to our infrastructure architect..."

üèõÔ∏è SC DevOps Architect (Morgan):
"Based on Alex's analysis, I recommend a single-image deployment with managed services:
‚Ä¢ MongoDB Atlas M10 cluster for reliability and automatic backups
‚Ä¢ AWS ElastiCache Redis for high-performance caching
‚Ä¢ S3 bucket with encryption for secure file storage
‚Ä¢ Estimated monthly cost: $180-250

This architecture provides excellent scalability and ~99.5% uptime. 
Coordinating with our setup orchestrator..."

üéØ SC Setup Master (Jordan):
"Perfect! I'll orchestrate the complete setup process. This will take approximately 15-20 minutes:

Phase 1: Project structure setup (2-3 minutes)
Phase 2: Resource configuration (5-8 minutes)  
Phase 3: Application configuration (3-5 minutes)
Phase 4: Validation and testing (5-7 minutes)

I'll need a few configuration values from you - all will be encrypted securely.
Ready to proceed?"

User: "Yes, let's do it!"

üéØ SC Setup Master (Jordan):
"Excellent! I need these secure values:

1. MongoDB connection string (for database access)
   Example: mongodb+srv://user:pass@cluster.mongodb.net/dbname

2. JWT secret key (for token signing)  
   Example: your-256-bit-secret-key

3. AWS credentials (for S3 access)
   - Access Key ID
   - Secret Access Key

Please provide these values:"

[User provides secure values]

‚öôÔ∏è SC Config Executor (Casey):
"Generating configurations with security best practices...

‚úÖ Created .sc/stacks/my-api/ directory structure
‚úÖ Generated client.yaml with MongoDB, Redis, and S3 resources
‚úÖ Encrypted secrets.yaml with 7 secure values
‚úÖ Configured single-image deployment settings
‚úÖ Validated all configurations

All configurations are ready and tested. Preparing for deployment validation..."

üöÄ SC Deployment Specialist (Riley):
"Running final validations and deployment readiness checks...

‚úÖ Configuration syntax validation passed
‚úÖ Resource connectivity tests passed
‚úÖ Security validation passed  
‚úÖ Performance baseline established

Your Go microservice is ready for deployment!

Next steps:
‚Ä¢ Run: sc deploy -s my-api -e staging
‚Ä¢ Monitor: Available dashboards will be created automatically
‚Ä¢ Access: Your API will be available at https://my-api-staging.simple-container.com

Setup complete! Your infrastructure is provisioned and ready."

## üì± Example 3: Simple Static Website

### User Interaction Flow (Abbreviated)

```
User: "I just want to deploy my HTML/CSS/JS website"

üß† SC Analyst Agent:
"I detect a simple static website:
‚Ä¢ HTML, CSS, JavaScript files
‚Ä¢ No server-side processing required
‚Ä¢ No database dependencies
‚Ä¢ Minimal configuration needed

This is perfect for static hosting!"

üèõÔ∏è SC DevOps Architect:
"Recommending static site deployment:
‚Ä¢ CDN hosting for global performance
‚Ä¢ SSL certificate for security
‚Ä¢ Custom domain support
‚Ä¢ Estimated cost: $5-15/month"

üéØ SC Setup Master:

## üîÑ Example 4: Error Handling and Recovery

### Scenario: Network Connectivity Issue During Setup

```
üéØ SC Setup Master:
"Starting Phase 2: Resource configuration..."

‚öôÔ∏è SC Config Executor:
"Configuring MongoDB Atlas connection..."
‚ùå Error: Connection timeout while validating MongoDB cluster

üéØ SC Setup Master:
"I encountered a connectivity issue. Let me diagnose and provide options:

Issue: Unable to connect to MongoDB Atlas
Possible causes:
1. Network connectivity issue
2. Incorrect connection string
3. Database cluster not ready

Options:
1. Retry with current settings (recommended)
2. Skip validation and proceed (advanced users)
3. Re-enter MongoDB connection string
4. Switch to different database provider

What would you like to do?"

User: "Let's retry"

üéØ SC Setup Master:
"Retrying with exponential backoff..."

‚öôÔ∏è SC Config Executor:
"‚úÖ MongoDB connection successful on retry
Continuing with resource configuration..."
```
