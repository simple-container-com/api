# BMAD Agent Specifications for Simple Container

## 🤖 Agent System Overview

The Simple Container BMAD-inspired agent system consists of 6 specialized agents, each with distinct roles and capabilities. This document provides specifications for each agent including their persona, commands, and interaction patterns.

## 🏗️ Common Agent Interface

```go
type Agent interface {
    ID() string                    // Unique agent identifier
    Name() string                  // Human-readable agent name  
    Persona() AgentPersona         // Agent personality and role
    Commands() []AgentCommand      // Available commands/capabilities
    CanHandle(task *Task) bool     // Task compatibility check
    Execute(ctx context.Context, task *Task, context *AgentContext) (*TaskResult, error)
}
```
