# Better Deployment Feedback & Diagnostics System

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Simple Container users frequently experience failed deployments with minimal diagnostic information, particularly:

- **ECS deployments timing out** waiting for tfState STABLE with no clear error details
- **Manual debugging required** - users must navigate to AWS/GCP/K8s consoles to diagnose issues
- **Poor user experience** - cryptic error messages without actionable guidance
- **Time-consuming troubleshooting** - average 15-30 minutes to identify root cause
- **Limited visibility** into deployment progress and container health

## 🚀 Solution Vision

Create an intelligent deployment diagnostics system that:

- **Automatically retrieves** detailed logs and metrics from cloud providers during deployments
- **Provides real-time feedback** with actionable error messages and resolution suggestions
- **Eliminates manual console navigation** by surfacing all relevant information in Simple Container CLI
- **Offers proactive monitoring** with early warning detection for common failure patterns
- **Supports multiple cloud providers** with unified diagnostic interface

## 📋 Feature Requirements

### Core Requirements
- Real-time deployment status monitoring with detailed progress indicators
- Automatic log retrieval from failed containers and services
- Metrics collection (CPU, memory, network, disk) during deployment phases  
- Cloud provider-specific diagnostic integration (AWS, GCP, Kubernetes)
- Intelligent error pattern recognition with suggested fixes
- Structured diagnostic reports with timeline and root cause analysis

### User Experience Requirements  
- Clear, actionable error messages instead of cryptic cloud provider errors
- Progressive disclosure of diagnostic information (summary → details → deep dive)
- Automatic retry suggestions with confidence scoring
- Integration with existing `sc deploy` command workflow
- Export capabilities for diagnostic reports (JSON, markdown)

### Technical Requirements
- Plugin architecture for cloud provider integrations
- Async diagnostic data collection with timeout handling
- Local caching of diagnostic data for offline analysis
- Security-conscious approach to accessing cloud provider APIs
- Performance optimization to minimize deployment time impact
