# Deploy Client Stack Action

## Overview

The **Deploy Client Stack Action** replaces the complex `build-and-deploy-service.yaml` workflow (467 lines) with a simple, reusable action that handles all aspects of deploying Simple Container application stacks.

## Action Purpose

**What it does**: Deploys application stacks (client.yaml configurations) to specified environments using Simple Container CLI.

**What it replaces**: The entire `build-and-deploy-service.yaml` workflow including:
- Complex preparation and metadata extraction
- Multi-stage build and deployment process  
- PR preview handling
- Custom configuration appending
- Validation execution
- Comprehensive notification system
