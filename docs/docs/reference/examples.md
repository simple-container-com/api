# **Examples**

## **Simplifying Microservice Deployment for Developers**

One of the biggest challenges in a **microservices architecture** is ensuring that **developers can deploy new services independently** without requiring constant DevOps involvement.

### **How `sc` Helps**

**Developers only need a `client.yaml` configuration** to deploy a new service.

**Familiar tooling** like **Dockerfile** and **docker-compose** keeps onboarding simple.

**No need for Terraform/Pulumi modifications** —DevOps manages infrastructure separately.

### **Example: Adding a New Microservice**
With traditional CI/CD pipelines, adding a microservice requires:

- **Infrastructure changes** (Terraform modules, Helm charts).
- **CI/CD pipeline configuration**.
- **Networking, secrets, and storage setup**.

With **`sc`**, a developer **only defines `client.yaml`**:

```yaml
---
schemaVersion: 1.0

stacks:
  staging:
    type: cloud-compose
    parent: myorg/devops
    config:
      dockerComposeFile: ./docker-compose.yaml
      uses:
        - postgres
      runs:
        - myservice
      env:
        POSTGRES_HOST: "${resource:postgres.host}"
        DATABASE_USER: "${resource:postgres.user}"
      secrets:
        DATABASE_PASSWORD: "${resource:postgres.password}"
```

**One simple YAML file replaces hours of DevOps work.**
**Developers focus on coding, not cloud infrastructure.**

---

## **Centralized Infrastructure Management for DevOps**

Traditional **microservice deployments** require DevOps teams to configure:

- **Cloud infrastructure** (AWS ECS, Kubernetes, networking).
- **Secrets management** (AWS Secrets Manager, Vault, Kubernetes Secrets).
- **State management** (Terraform or Pulumi state).

With `sc`, DevOps **only needs to define core infrastructure** in **`server.yaml`**:

```yaml
---
schemaVersion: 1.0

resources:
  staging:
    template: stack-per-app
    resources:
      postgres:
        type: gcp-cloudsql-postgres
        config:
          projectId: "${auth:gcloud.projectId}"
```

**Once defined, this setup supports all microservices without modifications.**

**Developers are isolated from infrastructure complexity.**

---

## **Built-in CI/CD, No Need for External Automation**

Most CI/CD tools **require custom scripts** for building, pushing, and deploying services. With `sc`:

**CI/CD is built-in** —no need for **Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or manual Helm deployments**.

**Deploy with a single command**:

```sh
sc deploy -s myservice -e staging
```
**Automatic rollbacks** make it safer than traditional pipelines.

### **Comparison: CI/CD Complexity**
| Feature                 | Traditional CI/CD                          | Simple Container        |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Pipeline Complexity** | Requires scripting (Bash, Terraform, Helm) |**Just use `sc deploy`**       |
| **Secret Injection** | Needs Vault, AWS Secrets Manager           |**Built-in (`sc secrets`)**    |
| **Rollback Mechanism** | Manual process                             |**Automated rollback support** |

## **Cloud-Agnostic & Easy Migration**

Organizations **often need to migrate workloads** between **AWS, GCP, and Kubernetes clusters**. With Terraform or Pulumi, migrations **require rewriting infrastructure code**.

With `sc`, migrations **only require modifying `server.yaml`**, while `client.yaml` remains **unchanged**.

**Move workloads from AWS to GCP without changing service configurations.**

**Supports AWS ECS, Kubernetes, and Google Cloud Run natively.**

**Example: Migrating from AWS to GCP**
- **Terraform/Pulumi:** Requires modifying state storage, networking, IAM policies.
- **SC:** Just update `server.yaml`,**no changes at the service level**.

```yaml
---
# Before (AWS)
resources:
  staging:
    template: stack-per-app
    resources:
      postgres:
        type: aws-rds-postgres
        config:
          instanceSize: "db.t3.micro"

# After (GCP)
resources:
  staging:
    template: stack-per-app
    resources:
      postgres:
        type: gcp-cloudsql-postgres
        config:
          instanceSize: "db-f1-micro"
```
**Migrate entire workloads in minutes, not weeks.**

---

## **Secure Secrets Management Built-In**

Managing secrets securely is **a major challenge in CI/CD**. Most organizations rely on **Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, or Kubernetes Secrets**, requiring **manual configuration**.

### **How `sc` Handles Secrets Automatically**

**Secrets are securely stored in the cloud provider's native secret manager**.

**No need for manual secret injection—SC provisions and injects secrets automatically.**

| Cloud Provider | Secrets Storage       |
|----------------|-----------------------|
| **AWS**        | AWS Secrets Manager   |
| **GCP**        | Google Secret Manager |
| **Kubernetes** | Kubernetes Secrets    |

Example **secret injection in `client.yaml`**:
```yaml
secrets:
  DATABASE_PASSWORD: "${resource:postgres.password}"
```
**Automatically stored in AWS/GCP/Kubernetes Secrets—fully managed by `sc`.**

## **Faster Time to Market with Less Overhead**

By adopting `sc`, organizations gain:

**Faster onboarding** —developers deploy services with a simple YAML config.

**Less DevOps overhead** —DevOps teams focus on core infrastructure, not microservices.

**Reduced CI/CD complexity** —built-in deployment automation eliminates external tooling.

### **Comparison: Developer Workflow**
| Task                       | Traditional Pipeline                 | SC-Powered Pipeline                          |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Add a new microservice** | Modify Terraform/Pulumi, Helm charts | Add `client.yaml`, deploy instantly          |
| **Manage secrets** | Requires Vault, AWS Secrets Manager  |**Built-in (`sc secrets`)**                  |
| **Deploy a service** | Manual CI/CD setup                   |**`sc deploy -s myservice -e staging`**      |
| **Migrate across clouds** | Requires rewriting Terraform/Pulumi  |**Update `server.yaml`, no service changes** |
