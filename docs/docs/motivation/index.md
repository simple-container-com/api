# **Examples**

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Simplifying Microservice Deployment for Developers**

One of the biggest challenges in a **microservices architecture** is ensuring that **developers can deploy new services independently** without requiring constant DevOps involvement.

### **How `sc` Helps**

‚úÖ **Developers only need a `client.yaml` configuration** to deploy a new service.

‚úÖ **Familiar tooling** like **Dockerfile** and **docker-compose** keeps onboarding simple.

‚úÖ **No need for Terraform/Pulumi modifications**‚ÄîDevOps manages infrastructure separately.

### **Example: Adding a New Microservice**
With traditional CI/CD pipelines, adding a microservice requires:

- **Infrastructure changes** (Terraform modules, Helm charts).
- **CI/CD pipeline configuration**.
- **Networking, secrets, and storage setup**.

With **`sc`**, a developer **only defines `client.yaml`**:

```yaml
---
schemaVersion: 1.0

stacks:
  staging:
    type: cloud-compose
    parent: myorg/devops
    config:
      dockerComposeFile: ./docker-compose.yaml
      uses:
        - postgres
      runs:
        - myservice
      env:
        POSTGRES_HOST: "${resource:postgres.host}"
        DATABASE_USER: "${resource:postgres.user}"
      secrets:
        DATABASE_PASSWORD: "${resource:postgres.password}"
```

‚úÖ **One simple YAML file replaces hours of DevOps work.**
‚úÖ **Developers focus on coding, not cloud infrastructure.**

---

## **2Ô∏è‚É£ Centralized Infrastructure Management for DevOps**

Traditional **microservice deployments** require DevOps teams to configure:

- **Cloud infrastructure** (AWS ECS, Kubernetes, networking).
- **Secrets management** (AWS Secrets Manager, Vault, Kubernetes Secrets).
- **State management** (Terraform or Pulumi state).

With `sc`, DevOps **only needs to define core infrastructure** in **`server.yaml`**:

```yaml
---
schemaVersion: 1.0

resources:
  staging:
    template: stack-per-app
    resources:
      postgres:
        type: gcp-cloudsql-postgres
        config:
          projectId: "${auth:gcloud.projectId}"
```

‚úÖ **Once defined, this setup supports all microservices without modifications.**

‚úÖ **Developers are isolated from infrastructure complexity.**

        config:
          instanceSize: "db-f1-micro"
```
‚úÖ **Migrate entire workloads in minutes, not weeks.**

---

## **5Ô∏è‚É£ Secure Secrets Management Built-In**

Managing secrets securely is **a major challenge in CI/CD**. Most organizations rely on **Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, or Kubernetes Secrets**, requiring **manual configuration**.

### **How `sc` Handles Secrets Automatically**

‚úÖ **Secrets are securely stored in the cloud provider's native secret manager**.

‚úÖ **No need for manual secret injection‚ÄîSC provisions and injects secrets automatically.**

| Cloud Provider | Secrets Storage       |
|----------------|-----------------------|
| **AWS**        | AWS Secrets Manager   |
| **GCP**        | Google Secret Manager |
| **Kubernetes** | Kubernetes Secrets    |

Example **secret injection in `client.yaml`**:
```yaml
secrets:
  DATABASE_PASSWORD: "${resource:postgres.password}"
```
‚úÖ **Automatically stored in AWS/GCP/Kubernetes Secrets‚Äîfully managed by `sc`.**
