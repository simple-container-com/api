# **Simple Container**

**Simple Container (`sc`)** is a **cloud-agnostic deployment tool** designed to simplify **microservices deployment, 
infrastructure provisioning, and CI/CD automation**. 

It allows **developers to deploy services effortlessly**, while **DevOps teams manage infrastructure centrally**, 
ensuring **scalability, security, and reliability across multi-cloud environments**.

2. **Effortless Microservice Deployment** – Deploy services with **one command**, using familiar tools like `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yaml`.
3. **Built-in Secrets Management** – Securely store and inject credentials using **AWS Secrets Manager, GCP Secret Manager, or Kubernetes Secrets**.
4. **Multi-Cloud & Kubernetes Support** – Seamlessly deploy to **AWS ECS, Google Cloud Run, Kubernetes clusters**, and more.
