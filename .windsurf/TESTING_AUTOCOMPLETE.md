## Regression Tests

### Existing Functionality
- [ ] `/help` works
- [ ] `/search` works
- [ ] `/analyze` works
- [ ] `/setup` works
- [ ] `/apikey` works
- [ ] `/provider` works
- [ ] `/status` works
- [ ] `/clear` works
- [ ] Regular chat works

## Platform-Specific Tests

### macOS
- [ ] Terminal.app works
- [ ] iTerm2 works
- [ ] Arrow keys work
- [ ] Tab works
- [ ] Ctrl+C works

### Linux
- [ ] gnome-terminal works
- [ ] konsole works

- [ ] All shortcuts work

### Non-TTY (Fallback)
```bash
# Pipe input
echo "/help" | ./bin/sc assistant chat
Expected: Falls back to simple input

# Redirect
./bin/sc assistant chat < commands.txt
Expected: Works without terminal features
```

## Automated Test Script

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# test-autocomplete.sh

echo "Testing autocomplete and history features..."

# Build
echo "Building..."
go build -o bin/sc ./cmd/sc || exit 1

# Test 1: Help autocomplete
echo "Test 1: Autocomplete /help"
# (Manual test required - terminal interaction)

# Test 2: History command
echo "Test 2: History command"
# (Manual test required - terminal interaction)

echo "Manual testing required for full coverage"
echo "See TESTING_AUTOCOMPLETE.md for test scenarios"
```

## Bug Report Template

If you find issues, report with:

```
**Bug:** [Brief description]

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Start chat
2. Type /h
3. Press Tab
4. [What happened]

**Expected:** [What should happen]
**Actual:** [What actually happened]

**Environment:**
- OS: macOS 14.0
- Terminal: iTerm2
- Go version: 1.24.0

**Additional Context:**
[Screenshots, logs, etc.]
```

## Success Criteria

All tests should pass with:
- âœ… No crashes
- âœ… Correct behavior
- âœ… Good performance
- âœ… Graceful error handling
- âœ… Backward compatibility

## Known Limitations

1. **Windows** - May have different terminal behavior
2. **Non-TTY** - Falls back to simple input (expected)
3. **History** - Not persisted across sessions (by design)
4. **Inline Suggestions** - May not work in all terminals

## Next Steps After Testing

1. Fix any bugs found
2. Optimize performance if needed
3. Add more tests
4. Consider persistent history
5. Add more keyboard shortcuts
