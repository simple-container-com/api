# Subcommand Autocomplete Feature

## Overview
Enhanced the autocomplete system to support **subcommand suggestions** - now you can see available subcommands when typing commands like `/provider`, `/apikey`, etc.

## Problem Solved
**Before:** You had to remember all subcommands
```bash
💬 /provider <what now?>
# Had to remember: list, switch, info
```

**After:** Press Tab to see options!
```bash
💬 /provider <Tab>
Suggestions:
  /provider list
  /provider switch
  /provider info
```

## How It Works

### 1. Command Autocomplete (Existing)
```bash
💬 /prov<Tab>
# Autocompletes to: /provider
```

### 2. Subcommand Autocomplete (NEW!)
```bash
# Show all subcommands
💬 /provider <Tab>
Suggestions:
  /provider list
  /provider switch
  /provider info

# Partial subcommand
💬 /provider s<Tab>
# Autocompletes to: /provider switch

# Or shows matches
💬 /apikey s<Tab>
Suggestions:
  /apikey set
  /apikey status
```

## Implementation Details

### New Function: `getSubcommandSuggestions()`
**File:** `pkg/assistant/chat/input.go`

```go
func (h *InputHandler) getSubcommandSuggestions(cmdName, subCmd string) []string {
    // Define subcommands for each command
    subcommands := map[string][]string{
        "apikey":   {"set", "delete", "status"},
        "provider": {"list", "switch", "info"},
        "history":  {"clear"},
        "switch":   {"dev", "devops", "general"},
        "help":     {}, // Shows all command names
    }
    
    // Get subcommands for this command
    subs := subcommands[cmdName]
    
    // If subCmd is empty, show all
    if subCmd == "" {
        return all subcommands
    }
    
    // Filter by prefix
    return matching subcommands
}
```

### Enhanced `getCommandSuggestions()`
```go
func (h *InputHandler) getCommandSuggestions(input string) []string {
    // Check if input contains a space (subcommand)
    parts := strings.Fields(input)
    
    if len(parts) > 1 {
        // Subcommand suggestions
        return h.getSubcommandSuggestions(parts[0], parts[1])
    }
    
    // Regular command suggestions
    return command matches
}
```

## Benefits

✅ **Command Discovery** - See what options are available  
✅ **Faster Input** - Less typing with autocomplete  
✅ **Reduced Errors** - No typos in subcommands  
✅ **Better UX** - Intuitive Tab completion  
✅ **Learning Aid** - Discover features as you type  

## Keyboard Flow

```
Type: /provider
Press: Space
Press: Tab
See: All subcommands
Type: s
Press: Tab
Result: Autocompletes to "switch"
Press: Enter
Execute: /provider switch
```

## Edge Cases Handled

1. **Empty Subcommand** - Shows all options
   ```bash
   💬 /provider <Tab>
   # Shows: list, switch, info
   ```

2. **Partial Match** - Filters options
   ```bash
   💬 /provider s<Tab>
   # Shows only: switch
   ```

3. **No Matches** - No suggestions
   ```bash
   💬 /provider xyz<Tab>
   # No suggestions (invalid)
   ```

4. **Single Match** - Auto-completes
   ```bash
   💬 /provider l<Tab>
   # Completes to: /provider list
   ```

5. **Multiple Tabs** - Shows suggestions again
   ```bash
   💬 /provider <Tab><Tab>
   # Shows suggestions each time
   ```

## Comparison

### Before (Command Only)
```bash
💬 /p<Tab>
# Completes to: /provider

💬 /provider [now what?]
# Had to type manually: list
```

### After (Command + Subcommand)
```bash
💬 /p<Tab>
# Completes to: /provider

💬 /provider <Tab>
Suggestions:
  /provider list
  /provider switch
  /provider info

# Select with Tab or type
💬 /provider l<Tab>
# Completes to: /provider list
```

## Testing

### Test 1: Show All Subcommands
```bash
💬 /provider <Tab>
Expected: Shows list, switch, info
```

### Test 2: Partial Subcommand
```bash
💬 /apikey s<Tab>
Expected: Shows set, status
```

### Test 3: Single Match
```bash
💬 /history c<Tab>
Expected: Autocompletes to /history clear
```

### Test 4: Help Command
```bash

Expected: Shows all command names
```

### Test 5: Mode Switch
